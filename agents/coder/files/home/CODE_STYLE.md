# Code style and architecture

These are standards for the code and its design. They describe what a good
implementation should look like; agent workflow, scope, TDD sequencing, and
validation requirements belong in `CODER.md`.

The goal is code that is understandable, changeable, testable, and resilient.
Prefer the simplest design that makes the behavior and business rules clear.
These are principles, not mechanical rules: use judgment and follow the
language, framework, and repository conventions when they are more appropriate.

## Clean code

- Write code for the next reader. Names, types, module boundaries, and control
  flow should communicate intent without requiring the reader to reconstruct
  the design from implementation details.
- Keep each function, type, and module cohesive. It should have one focused
  purpose and one primary reason to change. “One responsibility” does not mean
  one line or one operation; related behavior should live together.
- Prefer simple, direct code over cleverness. Do not introduce a pattern,
  generic abstraction, or indirection without a concrete problem it solves.
- Minimize hidden state, surprising mutations, implicit control flow, and
  action-at-a-distance. Make important effects visible in names, return
  values, types, or explicit commands.
- Optimize for changeability: a likely change should be local, understandable,
  and isolated from unrelated modules.

### Names and types

- Use precise, domain-oriented names. Names should express meaning, not merely
  implementation role.
- Avoid vague names such as `data`, `info`, `thing`, `helper`, `manager`,
  `handler`, `utils`, and `process` unless their meaning is genuinely clear in
  context.
- Use consistent terminology for the same concept throughout the codebase.
  Prefer full words except for established language or domain conventions.
- Name booleans as predicates (`isActive`, `canRetry`, `hasAccess`) and
  commands as verbs. Make it clear whether an operation reads, mutates,
  persists, or sends something.
- Prefer explicit types at public boundaries and for non-obvious values. Do
  not use `any`, untyped values, or broad maps to avoid making a design
  decision.
- At dynamic or untrusted boundaries, validate data immediately and convert
  it to a typed internal representation.
- Make invalid states difficult to represent with enums, constrained
  constructors, value objects, and types that preserve units and invariants.

### Functions and control flow

- A function should operate at one level of abstraction, have a clear name,
  and do one cohesive job. There is no universal line-count limit; split it
  when it mixes abstraction levels, has multiple independent reasons to
  change, or contains a meaningful part that can be understood separately.
- Keep argument lists understandable. Group genuinely related values into a
  named type, but do not use parameter objects to hide an incoherent API.
- Keep queries side-effect free where practical. Make commands' effects
  explicit and predictable.
- Prefer guard clauses when they reduce nesting. Use `if/else`, `switch`,
  pattern matching, and loops when they express the logic most clearly. Do
  not replace clear branching with clever polymorphism or dispatch tables just
  to avoid an `if`.
- Keep nesting shallow through clear extraction and early returns, but do not
  enforce an arbitrary indentation or function-length limit.
- Handle meaningful cases deliberately. Use exhaustive matching where the
  language supports it, and make impossible states fail clearly rather than
  silently selecting a surprising fallback.
- Avoid boolean flags that make one function perform unrelated workflows.
- Avoid premature generalization. A small amount of duplication can be safer
  than a wrong abstraction; extract shared code when its behavior, invariant,
  and reason for change are truly shared.

### Comments and documentation

- Prefer expressive code over explanatory comments. Comments should explain
  why a non-obvious decision exists, an invariant, a compatibility constraint,
  or an external-system limitation.
- Do not write comments that merely restate the code. Update or remove stale
  comments when behavior changes.
- Document public APIs with their purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects,
  errors, lifecycle expectations, and important invariants. Add examples when
  they clarify the contract.
- Link to an issue, specification, or upstream constraint when it explains a
  decision that future maintainers may otherwise undo.

## Architecture and modularity

- Keep public APIs small and intentional. Export only what callers need and
  keep implementation details private.
- Organize larger systems around features or domain capabilities when that
  improves cohesion. Do not create large technical-layer packages that make a
  single feature span many unrelated locations.
- Keep modules cohesive and avoid cycles. If two modules need each other,
  revisit ownership or introduce a narrow boundary owned by the caller.
- Prefer deep, useful modules: hide substantial implementation complexity
  behind a small, stable interface. Do not split code into shallow modules
  whose interfaces and wiring are more complex than the behavior they hide.
- Do not require every package to export an interface. Use an abstraction when
  it protects policy from a volatile detail, enables a real alternative, or
  materially improves testability. Prefer concrete types internally when no
  boundary requires indirection.
- Do not wrap every third-party library automatically. Create a project-owned
  boundary when vendor coupling, portability, domain translation, or
  testability justifies it.

### Dependency direction

Business policy should not depend on delivery mechanisms or infrastructure:

```text
frameworks / drivers / delivery / persistence
                    ↓
             application use cases
                    ↓
              domain policy and rules
```

Arrows represent dependencies. Inner policy must not import outer details such
as web frameworks, databases, queues, filesystems, clocks, or vendor SDKs.
Put those details behind ports/interfaces owned by the policy layer and
implement them in outer adapters. The exact number of layers is flexible; the
direction and ownership of the boundary are what matter.

- Keep the core usable without starting a server or connecting to a database.
- Assemble concrete dependencies at the application's composition root.
- Do not hide dependencies in service locators, mutable globals, or
  constructors with surprising side effects.
- Use dependency injection for resources that must vary, be replaced in
  tests, or be controlled by the application. Pure functions need no
  injection ceremony.
- Make transactions, retries, timeouts, idempotency, and concurrency
  boundaries explicit where they affect business behavior.

## Errors and invariants

- Validate untrusted input at system boundaries, then pass typed and
  normalized values inward. Enforce domain invariants wherever they could be
  violated by another caller.
- Treat expected failures as part of the API. Use typed/domain errors that
  callers can handle rather than undocumented error strings.
- Add context where an error gains meaning and preserve its original cause or
  stack. Do not swallow errors or catch broadly without a recovery strategy.
- Distinguish invalid input, conflicts, unavailable dependencies, programmer
  errors, and unexpected failures. Translate them to user/API responses at
  the outer boundary.
- Error messages should identify the operation and expected condition, plus a
  safe offending value or identifier when useful. Never include secrets,
  credentials, personal data, or unbounded raw payloads.
- Preserve invariants across state changes. Make transaction boundaries,
  partial-failure behavior, and retry safety explicit for stateful operations.

## Tests and testability

- Test observable behavior and contracts, not implementation details. Tests
  should survive internal refactoring that preserves behavior.
- Cover normal, boundary, invalid, and meaningful failure cases. Bug fixes
  should have regression coverage.
- Prefer table-driven or parameterized tests for related cases, with
  descriptive case names.
- Assert returned values, emitted events, persisted results, user-visible
  output, or other externally observable effects. Avoid tests that verify
  private call choreography.
- Test external systems at the appropriate level. Use fakes or contract-tested
  test doubles at unit boundaries, and focused integration tests for behavior
  that a fake cannot prove, such as serialization, queries, transactions, and
  vendor integration.
- Keep tests clear and cohesive. Test difficulty is design feedback: hard to
  test usually means a module has hidden dependencies, excessive responsibility,
  or an unclear contract.

## Refactoring and file structure

- Treat long functions, duplication, large modules, excessive conditionals,
  and tangled dependencies as signals to investigate, not automatic violations.
- Refactor in small, behavior-preserving steps protected by tests. Separate
  structural improvements from behavior changes when that makes the result
  easier to understand and review.
- Keep files focused and navigable. There is no universal file-size limit;
  split a file when ownership, cohesion, navigation, compilation, or change
  isolation suffers—not merely because it crossed an arbitrary line count.
- Preserve compatibility deliberately when changing public APIs, data formats,
  events, migrations, or persisted schemas.
