# TDD Rules

## 1. Core Rule

Always follow the TDD cycle:

1. **RED** — Write the smallest test that fails for the intended behavior.
2. **GREEN** — Write the minimum production code required to make the test pass.
3. **REFACTOR** — Improve the design without changing behavior.
4. Run the relevant test suite after each cycle.

Never implement the behavior first and write tests afterward.

---

## 2. Test Behavior, Not Implementation

* Test observable behavior and outcomes.
* Do not test private methods, internal variables, implementation details, or call sequences unless they are part of the contract.
* Tests should survive reasonable refactoring of the implementation.
* Prefer testing through the public API of the unit under test.

Bad:

```go
assert.Equal(t, 3, service.calculateInternalTotal())
```

Good:

```go
assert.Equal(t, 300, service.CalculateOrderTotal(order))
```

---

## 3. One Behavioral Reason Per Test

Each test should verify one meaningful behavior.

Prefer:

```text
returns the total including tax
rejects an expired token
does not publish an event when persistence fails
```

Avoid tests that verify several unrelated behaviors simultaneously.

A test may contain multiple assertions when they collectively describe the same behavior.

---

## 4. Start With the Simplest Case

Implement behavior incrementally.

Typical progression:

1. Happy path
2. Important boundary conditions
3. Invalid input
4. Error handling
5. Exceptional/edge cases
6. Performance or concurrency requirements when applicable

Do not implement speculative behavior that has no failing test.

---

## 5. Keep Tests Deterministic

Tests must not depend on:

* Current time
* Randomness
* Network availability
* External services
* Machine-specific configuration
* Test execution order
* Shared mutable state

Inject sources of nondeterminism:

```go
type Clock interface {
    Now() time.Time
}
```

Use deterministic implementations in tests.

---

## 6. Minimize Test Doubles

Do not mock everything.

Prefer, in order:

1. Real in-memory implementations
2. Fakes
3. Stubs
4. Mocks

Use mocks only when interaction with an external dependency is itself part of the behavior being verified.

Avoid mocking internal collaborators merely to make unit tests easier.

---

## 7. Avoid Over-Specifying Interactions

Do not assert implementation details such as:

```text
method A must call B exactly once
B must be called before C
repository method X must receive this exact internal object
```

unless those interactions are contractual behavior.

Prefer:

```text
given X, the resulting state is Y
given X, the returned error is Z
given X, event Y is published
```

---

## 8. Tests Must Be Independent

Every test must:

* Arrange its own state.
* Avoid depending on another test.
* Be safe to run in isolation.
* Be safe to run in any order.
* Clean up resources it creates.

Never use shared mutable test state unless it is explicitly controlled and reset.

---

## 9. Make Tests Read Like Specifications

Test names should describe behavior and expected outcome.

Prefer:

```text
returnsUnauthorizedWhenTokenIsExpired
publishesInvoiceCreatedEventAfterSuccessfulPersistence
rejectsOrderWhenCustomerHasInsufficientCredit
```

Avoid:

```text
testCalculate
testService
testCase1
shouldWork
```

Use Arrange → Act → Assert structure:

```go
// Arrange
order := newOrder()

// Act
result, err := service.Process(order)

// Assert
require.NoError(t, err)
assert.Equal(t, expected, result)
```

Keep each section obvious.

---

## 10. Keep Tests Fast

The default test suite should execute quickly.

* Unit tests should be milliseconds-scale where practical.
* Avoid unnecessary I/O.
* Avoid starting infrastructure for tests that do not require it.
* Separate slower integration/e2e tests from the unit suite.
* Run focused tests during the TDD loop.

Fast feedback is a core requirement of TDD.

---

## 11. Use Integration Tests Where Boundaries Matter

Unit tests do not replace integration tests.

Use integration tests to verify:

* Database behavior
* SQL queries
* Transactions
* Serialization/deserialization
* HTTP contracts
* Message brokers
* External system integration
* Dependency configuration

Do not mock a database query so heavily that the test verifies the mock instead of the query.

---

## 12. Test Error Paths Explicitly

Every meaningful failure mode should have a test.

Examples:

```text
dependency unavailable
invalid input
not found
duplicate resource
authorization failure
transaction failure
timeout
partial failure
```

Do not rely on happy-path tests to implicitly cover error handling.

---

## 13. Preserve Error Semantics

Tests should verify meaningful error behavior:

* Correct error type/category
* Correct domain error
* Correct wrapping/unwrapping behavior
* Appropriate HTTP/status mapping where applicable

Avoid asserting fragile error strings unless the exact message is part of the contract.

---

## 14. Refactor Only After GREEN

Never mix behavioral changes with refactoring.

Correct:

```text
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
```

During refactoring:

* Tests must remain green.
* Do not add new behavior.
* Do not change requirements.
* Improve naming, structure, duplication, abstractions, and complexity.

If a refactor requires changing tests because the tests were coupled to implementation details, improve the tests.

---

## 15. Do Not Write Tests Solely for Coverage

Code coverage is a diagnostic metric, not the goal.

Do not:

* Add meaningless assertions to increase coverage.
* Test trivial getters/setters solely for coverage.
* Create tests that execute code without verifying behavior.

Prioritize coverage of important behavior, boundaries, failure modes, and business rules.

---

## 16. Do Not Add Abstractions Without a Reason

TDD does not mean creating interfaces everywhere.

Introduce an abstraction when there is a concrete design reason:

* Multiple implementations
* External dependency isolation
* Architectural boundary
* Required substitution in tests
* Independent evolution of components

Do not create interfaces merely because "interfaces make code testable."

---

## 17. Tests Are Production Code

Apply the same engineering standards to tests as production code.

Tests must have:

* Clear naming
* Small functions
* Minimal duplication
* Proper abstractions
* No dead code
* No unexplained magic values
* Consistent formatting
* Maintainable structure

A bad test suite is technical debt.

---

## 18. Fix Broken Tests Immediately

Never:

* Ignore a failing test.
* Disable a test without a documented reason.
* Comment out assertions.
* Add retries to hide flaky behavior.
* Accept known flaky tests as normal.

A failing test means one of three things:

1. The implementation is wrong.
2. The test is wrong.
3. The requirement changed.

Determine which one and fix it immediately.

---

## 19. Regression Rule

Every bug fix must include a regression test.

Process:

```text
Reproduce bug with a failing test
        ↓
Fix implementation
        ↓
Verify test passes
        ↓
Keep regression test permanently
```

Never fix a reproducible bug without encoding it into the test suite.

---

## 20. Property-Based Testing

Use property-based testing when behavior is better expressed through invariants than individual examples.

Good candidates:

* Parsers
* Serialization
* Mathematical transformations
* Data normalization
* Collections
* State transitions
* Idempotency

Example invariant:

```text
deserialize(serialize(x)) == x
```

---

## 21. Contract Testing

For service boundaries, test contracts independently of implementation.

Verify:

* Request schema
* Response schema
* Required fields
* Error contracts
* Compatibility requirements

Contract tests are especially valuable for APIs and event-driven systems.

---

## 22. TDD Is Not an Excuse for Poor Design

If code is difficult to test, first question the design.

Common warning signs:

* Huge constructors
* Excessive dependencies
* Global state
* Hidden I/O
* Static dependencies
* Deeply coupled modules
* Large functions
* Mixed business logic and infrastructure

Do not solve structural problems by adding increasingly complex mocks.

Refactor the design.

---

## 23. Definition of Done

A behavioral change is complete only when:

* A test existed that failed before the implementation.
* The implementation makes the test pass.
* Relevant edge cases are covered.
* Relevant failure paths are covered.
* Tests are deterministic.
* Tests are independent.
* The implementation has been refactored where necessary.
* The relevant test suite passes.
* The full regression suite passes.
* No test has been weakened or disabled to obtain GREEN.

---

## 24. TDD Decision Rule

Before writing production code, ask:

> "What observable behavior am I implementing, and what test currently proves that this behavior is missing?"

If there is no clear answer, do not write the production code yet.
