# Install the Claude Code plugins listed in a config file.
#
# Usage: install-claude-plugins [config.json]
#
# The config is JSON so it can be edited without touching the Dockerfile:
#
#   {
#     "marketplaces": ["anthropics/claude-plugins-official"],
#     "plugins":      ["superpowers@claude-plugins-official"]
#   }
#
# Skills are not a separate entry: Claude Code installs skills as part of a
# plugin, so listing the plugin is what brings its skills in.
#
# Run at image build time as the agent user, and available inside a running
# sandbox -- with no arguments it reads the config the image was built from, so
# re-running it repairs a sandbox whose plugin state was lost.
#
# Both lists matter. The cache alone is not enough: a plugin whose marketplace
# is not declared in the user settings cannot be refreshed or re-resolved, and a
# plugin absent from `enabledPlugins` is on disk but never loaded. `plugin
# install` writes both, which is why this shells out to the CLI rather than
# assembling the JSON by hand.
